# Notice

Each folder from this directory are the sprites that still needs work. I am putting here in case anyone wants to help because I spent way too much time and I believe I better focus on new features than spending time on the sprites.

## Explanations:

1. Inside of each folder, there are usually two PNG files.

- Current.png : Currently using on the project
- All-Sprites.png : All sprites that needs to be sorted

## What do do?

1. Download All-Sprites
2. Use a image editor (i.e: Pixelmator)
3. Organize it in order
4. Save as PNG
5. Find a way to reach me or open an issue. Include detail information such as which sprite you have worked on and the link to download.
